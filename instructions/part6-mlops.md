#### ML.NET + Azure DevOps = MLOps
How do you keep your model up to date, as your data and the code used during training changes?
What about automatic deployments to your Azure Function or ASP.NET Core Web API? 

Just as CI/CD and DevOps revolutionized development and infrastructure management, we can apply the same principles to the training and deployment of your machine learning model.
For demonstration purposes, we'll use Azure DevOps.

##### 1. Getting started
- Azure DevOps
- Github repo

##### 2. Setting up a CI pipeline
- Creating a build pipeline
- YAML
- Creating an Azure File share
- Uploading a small file
- Attaching it during the pipeline
- Modifying the code to point to new location

##### 3. Adding unit tests

##### 4. Setting up a CD pipeline
