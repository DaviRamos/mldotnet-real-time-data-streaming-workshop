### Training your Machine Learning Model using Jupyter + ML.NET
Jupyter Notebooks is an excellent environment to document and train your machine learning model in. 
It allows Data Scientists to execute code, cell by cell, as well as explore and plot the data to further understand any hidden relationships. Jupyter Notebooks are initially built for Julia + Python + R, and is at the heart of data science.

The ML.NET team is currently working on support for a C# kernel within Jupyter, as well as the possibility to run ML.NET code in a Jupyter Notebook. This adds a lot of exciting possibilities, and among the most useful, plotting and data exploration.

In this section, we'll get familiar working with Jupyter Notebooks, and take a look at the direction the ML.NET team is heading towards.

Please note, as of time of writing, this has not yet been released for public preview or general availability. In this workshop we'll be looking at a private preview.

### Steps

1. Open the link to MyBinder, provided during the workshop
2. Upload the [following](https://github.com/aslotte/mldotnet-real-time-data-streaming-workshop/blob/master/src/machine-learning/jupyter/fraudulent-classifier-mlnet.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook
3. Click on Cells -> Run All
4. Compare how training a model in Visual Studio Code is different than when working with a Jupyter Notebook
