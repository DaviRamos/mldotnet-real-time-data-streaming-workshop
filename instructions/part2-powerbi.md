### Creating a dashboard
To create a dashboard using a streaming API as a source, follow the steps below
1. Navigate to https://app.powerbi.com/ and log-in to your Power BI account
2. If you haven't started the event-producer yet, as well as your Azure Stream Analytics Job, make sure to do so (the dataset only appears after that)
3. Select to create a new dashboard
4. In your dashboard, select to Add a new tile. For the tile type, select "Custom Streaming Data"
5. Select what the tile should represent 

You may for example add card and line graphs to display total fraudulent amount lost over time or number of fraudulent transactions over time.
