### Training your Machine Learning Model using ML.NET
In this section we will be training our Machine Learning model by first manually writing the code to do so, and then looking at how ML.NET may automatically generate a model for you.

#### Using a Machine Learning Pipeline in .NET
To build your machine learning model using ML.NET, please refer to the following [guide](https://github.com/aslotte/mldotnet-real-time-data-streaming-workshop/blob/master/instructions/part1-mldotnet.md)

#### Using AutoML (CLI/Visual Studio Extension)
To build your machine learning model using ML.NET's AutoML builder, please refer to the following [guide](https://github.com/aslotte/mldotnet-real-time-data-streaming-workshop/blob/master/instructions/part1-automl.md)
